# DSA + LeetCode ðŸš€

This repository is a combined collection of **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** concepts and **LeetCode problem solutions**.  
The goal is to build strong fundamentals in DSA while practicing real-world coding interview problems.

## ðŸ“– Whatâ€™s Inside?
- **DSA Notes & Implementations**  
  Step-by-step explanations and Python implementations of core topics like Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming, and more.  

- **LeetCode Solutions**  
  Solved problems organized by **patterns** and **difficulty (Easy / Medium / Hard)** with clean, well-documented code.  

- **Learning Roadmap**  
  A structured guide to help track progress from basics to advanced problem-solving.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why This Repo?
- Acts as a **personal learning tracker**.  
- Useful for **interview preparation**.  
- Combines both **theory (DSA)** and **practice (LeetCode)** in one place.  
- Easy to navigate with categorized folders and notes.
